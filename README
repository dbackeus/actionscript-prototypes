=== Description

Prototypes for actionscript.

In need of documentation.
Under refactoring to include/remove prototypes through classes instead of using #include.
Working on a test suite using my home grown work in progress LeanUnit framework (also on github). 

=== Usage

Move the proto.as file to your .fla directory and put:

#include "proto.as"

In the first framescript of your .fla file.
